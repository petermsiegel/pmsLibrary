⍝    ptrs@ns ← [⍺:alpha] ⍺⍺:user_fn@{}  ∆FPTR ⍵:omega
⍝    Create  function "pointer"  or array of function pointers (function namespaces)
⍝      ptrs← [alpha] {fn1} ∆FPTR {fn2} ∆FPTR ... ∆FPTR omega
⍝    If there is one fn (⍺⍺), then <arr> is a scalar. This makes it easy to call directly:
⍝           ptrs← {fn1} ∆FPTR 0 ⋄ 1 2 3 arr.fn 10
⍝    If there are more, then <arr> is a vector. This allows you to distribute arguments to functions easily:
⍝           ptrs ← {fn1} ∆FPTR {fn2} ∆FPTR {fn3} ∆FPTR 0   ⍝ 3 fn ptrs
⍝           1 2 3 ptrs.∆fn 100 200 300                      ⍝ calls 1 fn1 100, 2 fn2 200, 3 fn3 300
⍝
⍝    Each namespace in <ptrs> will have
⍝      ∆ALPHA -- ⍺ from the ∆FPTR call, if defined, else ⎕NULL
⍝      ∆OMEGA -- ⍵ from the ∆FPTR call, i.e. rightmost ⍵, whose first item must not be a namespace
⍝      ∆NARGS -- 2 if ⍺ (∆ALPHA) is defined, else 1
⍝      ∆ID    -- which ∆FPTR in the sequence, from left to right,
⍝                with the left-most having ∆ID=⎕IO, incrementing by 1.
⍝      ∆fn    -- the function passed as ⍺⍺.  You can call it with your own args ⍺ (optional) and ⍵,
⍝                and it can refer to ∆ALPHA, ∆OMEGA, ∆NARGS, and ∆ID
⍝    Note: Each namespace will have (overriding any earlier values set)
⍝          the SAME ∆ALPHA as passed by the left-most ∆FPTR and
⍝          the SAME ∆OMEGA as passed by the right-most ∆FPTR
